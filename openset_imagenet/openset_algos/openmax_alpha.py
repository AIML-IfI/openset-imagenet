The original source code computes the probability scores over all classes, including an
additionally introduced pseudo-class that represents the unknown class. This implies that it 
is possible that the probability score of this unknown class is returned. Since this behaviour
is unwanted in light of the experiments, an additional flag 'ignore_unknown_class' has been
added to the signature. If this flag is set to 'True', the unknown class is clipped from the
probability tensor and only the probability scores of the known classes are returned. This in
turn is in line with the definition of the OSCR metric for unknown samples.
